                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an aspiring full stack web developer with a background in computer science from AMA University in the Philippines. Currently working as an Apple technical support call center agent, I am dedicated to transitioning into a fulfilling career in web development.

                <p>
                    Driven by my passion for creating innovative solutions and embracing the constant growth of the programming field, I am actively studying and expanding my skills to become a proficient full stack developer. With a background in computer science and a strong drive to utilize my knowledge effectively, my goal is to secure a position where I can leverage my expertise, contribute to exciting projects, and be part of a dynamic team. While I have a preference for remote work due to its flexibility and productivity advantages, I am open to considering other options that align with my career goals. My primary focus is on finding opportunities where I can make a meaningful impact, continuously learn, and grow both professionally and personally.

                <p>
                    Throughout my journey, I have had the privilege of experiencing two diverse worlds, living between the Philippines and the US. This unique perspective has broadened my horizons and nurtured my adaptability and cultural sensitivity.

                <p>
                    When not immersed in coding, I find solace in exploring new destinations, whether through plane journeys or exciting road trips. I also enjoy immersing myself in captivating stories through movies and shows, as they provide a source of inspiration and fuel my creativity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As I embark on this career transition, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. I am eager to contribute my skills, continue my professional growth, and make a meaningful impact within the web development industry.
